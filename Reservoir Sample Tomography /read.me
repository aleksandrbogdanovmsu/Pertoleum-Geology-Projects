- Description: Reservoir sample tomography is considered the most accurate and functional petrophysical method for studying pore space. However, the results yield a large amount of data per sample, making processing cumbersome. This project utilizes pandas with grouping and bin container creation to effectively segment pore spaces by diameter.
- Technologies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
